# Adaptive Learning System

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is building a sophisticated Adaptive Learning System designed to personalize the educational experience for learners, focusing initially on programming and data structures concepts. By tracking learner progress, understanding individual needs and preferences, and dynamically adjusting the learning path and challenge difficulty, the system aims to maximize learning efficiency, engagement, and mastery.

The core principle is to move beyond one-size-fits-all education towards a truly adaptive and learner-centric approach.

## 🎯 Project Goals & Objectives

*   **Personalize Learning Paths:** Tailor the sequence of learning content and activities based on individual learner progress, competency levels, and learning styles.
*   **Track Learner Mastery:** Develop a robust model to assess and track a learner's mastery of specific skills and concepts at a granular level.
*   **Enable Adaptive Challenge Selection:** Select learning activities and challenges that are optimally challenging for the learner based on their current competency.
*   **Provide Data-Driven Insights:** Offer valuable insights into learner performance, progress, and potential areas for improvement for both learners and potentially educators/managers.
*   **Ensure Scalability and Efficiency:** Design the system to efficiently handle a large number of learners and vast amounts of performance data.
*   **Prioritize Ethical Data Handling:** Implement strong data privacy, security, and consent mechanisms in accordance with ethical guidelines and regulations (like GDPR).

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Comprehensive Learner Profile Management:** Capture learner demographics, learning preferences, prior experience, and accessibility needs.
*   **Detailed Performance Tracking:** Log learner interactions, activity completions, scores, attempts, and actions within various learning activities (quizzes, coding challenges, interactive exercises).
*   **Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) Engine:** Implement a BKT-based model to probabilistically assess and update learner competency levels for specific micro-competencies.
*   **Adaptive Content and Challenge Delivery:** Logic for selecting and recommending learning modules, lessons, and challenges based on assessed competency levels.
*   **Assessment Data Integration:** (Future feature) Integrate external assessment data (e.g., Talent Q Dimensions reports) to enrich learner profiles and influence personalization.
*   **Self-Reported Data Integration:** Capture and utilize learner-provided data such as confidence levels and learning goals.
*   **API for Data Access:** (Future feature) Provide a secure API for accessing learner progress and competency data.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

*   **Backend/API:** Python (e.g., FastAPI or Flask) or Node.js (Express.js) - *Choice pending finalization, initial prototypes may use one or both.*
*   **Database:** MongoDB (Atlas preferred) - *Chosen for flexibility and scalability with semi-structured data.*
*   **Core Adaptive Algorithm:** Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT).
*   **Data Integration:** Potentially Python (Pandas) or other ETL tools for processing assessment data imports.
*   **Containerization:** Docker.
*   **Version Control:** Git.

*(Note: This project is utilizing AI-assisted processes for generating and maintaining its documentation set, enhancing efficiency and consistency.)*

## ▶️ Getting Started

*(Note: This project is currently in the development phase. Setup requires access to a MongoDB Atlas cluster.)*

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.x (if using Python backend)
    *   Node.js and npm (if using Node.js backend or Node.js scripts)
    *   MongoDB Atlas Cluster connection string
    *   Git

2.  **Installation:**
    ```bash
    # Clone the repository
    git clone [Repository URL - Replace with actual URL]
    cd [Project Directory - Replace with actual directory name]

    # Install dependencies (choose based on backend language/scripts used)
    pip install -r requirements.txt   # For Python dependencies (if needed)
    npm install                       # For Node.js dependencies (if needed)
    npm install uuid                  # Specific dependency for UUID generation
    ```

3.  **Configuration:**
    *   Set your MongoDB Atlas connection string as an environment variable named `MONGODB_URI`.
        *   Linux/macOS: `export MONGODB_URI="your_connection_string"`
        *   Windows (CMD): `set MONGODB_URI=your_connection_string`
        *   Windows (PowerShell): `$Env:MONGODB_URI="your_connection_string"`
    *   Configure any other necessary environment variables or configuration files (details would be in `./docs/configuration.md`).

4.  **Running Basic Scripts (Examples):**

    *   **Create Initial Collections (Node.js):**
        ```bash
        node scripts/create_collections.js # Assuming you have this script
        ```
    *   **Import Users (Node.js):**
        ```bash
        node scripts/import_users.js
        ```
    *   **Run BKT Update (Python):**
        ```bash
        python scripts/bkt_update.py
        ```

    *(Note: These scripts require corresponding files in the `./scripts` directory based on our previous discussions.)*
