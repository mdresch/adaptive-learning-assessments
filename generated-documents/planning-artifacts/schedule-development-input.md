# Schedule Development Input for Adaptive Learning System Project

## 1. Project Management Plan

The Project Management Plan provides foundational inputs to schedule development, including the schedule management plan, scope baseline, and resource management plan.

- **Schedule Management Plan (from Project Management Plan)**
  - Defines the methodology, tools, and templates used for schedule development and control.
  - Specifies scheduling software or tools (e.g., MS Project, Primavera, or equivalent).
  - Establishes scheduling rules, such as work calendars, holidays, and resource calendars.
  - Defines schedule performance measurement criteria (e.g., Earned Value Management metrics).
  - Details schedule change control procedures.

- **Scope Baseline**
  - Includes the Project Scope Statement, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and WBS Dictionary.
  - Provides the detailed deliverables, work packages, and activities that form the basis for schedule development.
  - Ensures all project work is accounted for in the schedule.

- **Resource Management Plan**
  - Defines resource availability, roles, responsibilities, and resource calendars.
  - Provides input for estimating activity durations and sequencing activities based on resource constraints.

## 2. Project Documents

- **Activity List**
  - A comprehensive list of all the schedule activities required to complete the project deliverables.
  - Extracted from the WBS decomposition.
  
- **Activity Attributes**
  - Additional details about each activity such as predecessor and successor activities, logical relationships, resource requirements, constraints, and assumptions.

- **Milestone List**
  - Key project milestones including major deliverable completion dates, phase gates, and regulatory or compliance deadlines (e.g., GDPR compliance checkpoints).

- **Project Schedule Network Diagrams**
  - Visual representations of activity sequencing and dependencies to assist in schedule sequencing and critical path identification.

- **Resource Calendars**
  - Availability schedules of human resources, equipment, and materials defining when resources can be assigned to activities.

- **Risk Register**
  - Identifies risks that could impact the schedule, such as technical risks related to the BKT engine implementation or third-party API integration delays.
  - Includes risk mitigation and contingency plans that may influence schedule buffers or contingency reserves.

- **Project Team Assignments**
  - Availability and allocation of project team members and external stakeholders.
  - Helps to identify resource constraints impacting schedule development.

- **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)**
  - Organizational culture, existing systems, scheduling tools, and templates.
  - External factors such as market conditions, vendor lead times, regulatory environment (e.g., GDPR compliance deadlines).

- **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)**
  - Historical information and lessons learned from similar adaptive learning or educational software projects.
  - Standard scheduling policies, procedures, and guidelines.
  - Previous project schedules, templates, and standard activity durations.

## 3. Agreements and Contracts

- Any contracts or service agreements with vendors, third-party service providers or consultants (e.g., cloud hosting providers, data analytics consultants).
- Contractual delivery dates and milestones that must be integrated into the project schedule.

## 4. Assumptions and Constraints

- Assumptions related to resource availability, technology stack finalization (Python vs Node.js backend decision timeline).
- Constraints such as fixed delivery dates for initial pilot release, budget limitations impacting resource allocation.
- Technical constraints, e.g., dependency on MongoDB Atlas availability and performance.

### Notes Specific to Adaptive Learning System Project:

- The schedule must accommodate iterative development cycles, prototyping, and integration of core adaptive algorithms (BKT engine).
- Consider phased delivery milestones: prototype, alpha, beta, and production releases.
- Integration of future features (Assessment Data Integration, API for Data Access) should be reflected as later phase milestones.
- Ethical data handling and GDPR compliance checkpoints must be included as critical milestones.
- Resource calendars must consider availability of specialized data scientists and backend developers skilled in Python and Node.js.
- Dependencies between scripts (e.g., `import_users.js` and `bkt_update.py`) and containerization (Docker) must be accounted for in sequencing.
