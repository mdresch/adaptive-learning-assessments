### Notes:
- **Expected Duration (TE)** is the weighted average based on PERT formula: TE = (O + 4M + P) / 6
- Durations are in **person-days**. Adjust for team size or calendar days accordingly.
- Some activities (e.g., Frontend UI) are optional or dependent on project scope decisions.
- Future features (like API for Data Access, Assessment Data Integration) are estimated separately as they might be phased.
- Buffer/Contingency is included to cover unforeseen delays and risks.

### Example Calculation for Activity 4 (Backend API Development):
- O = 20 days (best case: smooth development)
- M = 30 days (most likely scenario)
- P = 45 days (worst case: complex issues, delays)
- TE = (20 + 4*30 + 45) / 6 = (20 + 120 + 45)/6 = 185/6 â‰ˆ 31.67 days

If you want, I can also provide a summary schedule or convert these into calendar durations based on resource availability. Let me know!
