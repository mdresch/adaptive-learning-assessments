### Explanation of Three-Point Estimation Calculation:

\[
TE = \frac{O + 4M + P}{6}
\]

Where:  
- **O** = Optimistic estimate (best-case scenario)  
- **M** = Most likely estimate (normal scenario)  
- **P** = Pessimistic estimate (worst-case scenario)  
- **TE** = Expected duration

---

### Summary of Total Duration

- Sum of Expected Durations (TE) = **~128.5 workdays**

This estimate does **not** include parallelism or resource allocation effects. Actual calendar duration will depend on resource availability and scheduling.

---

### How to Use This Estimate

- Use the Expected Duration (TE) values for scheduling.
- Use Optimistic and Pessimistic values for risk analysis and contingency planning.
- Adjust estimates based on team velocity and actual progress during execution.

If you want, I can also help create a Gantt chart or schedule based on these estimates! Would you like that?
