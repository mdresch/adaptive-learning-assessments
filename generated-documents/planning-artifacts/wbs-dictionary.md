# Notes:  
- Each WBS element corresponds to a major deliverable or group of related activities.  
- Sub-elements (e.g., 4.1, 4.2) allow more granularity for planning and control.  
- This WBS Dictionary should be maintained in the project documentation folder (`./docs/wbs_dictionary.md`) and updated as the project evolves.
