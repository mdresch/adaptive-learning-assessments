### Notes:
- Target Dates should be assigned during project scheduling based on resource availability and dependencies.
- Some milestones (e.g., M15, M16) are marked as future features and can be planned for later phases or releases.
- Milestones should be tracked in the project schedule tool with associated tasks and deliverables.
- Each milestone completion should have formal acceptance criteria and sign-off from relevant stakeholders.
