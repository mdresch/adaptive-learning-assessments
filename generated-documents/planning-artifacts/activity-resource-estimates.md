## 5. Resource Optimization Strategies and Alternatives

- **Cross-functional staffing:** Employ developers skilled in both backend and data engineering to reduce handoffs.
- **Agile resource allocation:** Dynamically assign developers between backend API and BKT engine tasks based on sprint priorities.
- **Use open-source tools:** Minimize licensing costs by relying on open-source frameworks and libraries.
- **Cloud auto-scaling:** Use MongoDB Atlas and cloud hosting with auto-scaling to optimize infrastructure costs.
- **Remote work:** Leverage remote developers in lower-cost regions while maintaining core team onsite or in overlapping time zones.
- **Training upskilling:** Accelerate mid-level developers’ skills toward senior-level competencies to reduce dependency on costly senior experts.
