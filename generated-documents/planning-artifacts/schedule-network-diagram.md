### Explanation:

- **A (Project Initiation & Setup):** Start of the project.
- **B (Requirements Gathering & Analysis):** Define detailed requirements based on project goals.
- **C (Design Adaptive Learning Model):** Design the core algorithm (BKT engine).
- **D (Design System Architecture):** Define architecture for modular system components.
- **E (Develop Learner Profile Management Module):** Backend for managing learner data.
- **F (Develop Performance Tracking Module):** Logging and tracking learner interactions.
- **G (Develop Bayesian Knowledge Tracing Engine):** Implement BKT model.
- **H (Develop Adaptive Content Delivery Logic):** Logic for personalized learning paths.
- **I (Develop API & Integration Layer):** Interfaces for frontend and future integrations.
- **J (Implement Data Privacy & Security Mechanisms):** GDPR and ethical data handling.
- **K (Testing & Quality Assurance):** Unit, integration, and system testing.
- **L (Deployment & Scalability Setup):** Dockerization, cloud deployment, scalability configuration.
- **M (Documentation & User Guides):** Throughout the project, finalize docs.
- **N (Project Closeout):** Final review, handover, and closure.

This schedule network diagram emphasizes dependencies and logical flow of tasks, supporting adaptive and incremental development aligned with PMBOK principles.
