### Explanation of the Schedule Network Diagram:

- **Project Initiation & Setup (A)** is the starting point of the project, including environment setup, repository cloning, and initial configuration.
- **Design phases (B, C)** run in parallel to define requirements and designs for Learner Profile Management and Performance Tracking modules.
- **Development phases (D, E)** follow design completion for each module.
- The **BKT Engine (F)** development depends on both Learner Profile and Performance Tracking modules being developed.
- **Adaptive Content & Challenge Delivery (G)** development depends on the BKT engine being ready.
- **Data Privacy & Security Implementation (H)** runs parallel but must be completed before integration/testing.
- **Integration & System Testing (I)** depends on the core modules and security implementation.
- **Documentation & Training Materials (J)** and **Deployment & Monitoring Setup (K)** follow successful testing.
- **Future Feature Planning (L)** starts after deployment.

This network diagram reflects logical sequencing and parallelism aligned with PMBOK principles for schedule development and management.
