# Project Summary: Adaptive Learning System

## Overview
The Adaptive Learning System project aims to revolutionize the educational experience by creating a personalized, learner-centric platform focused initially on programming and data structures. Unlike traditional one-size-fits-all educational models, this system dynamically adapts to each learner’s unique progress, preferences, and competencies. By leveraging sophisticated data tracking and the Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) algorithm, the system continuously assesses mastery of granular skills to tailor learning paths and challenge difficulties. This approach strives to maximize learning efficiency, engagement, and mastery, ultimately fostering deeper understanding and skill acquisition.

The system's architecture is designed for scalability, ethical data handling, and extensibility, incorporating future features such as integration with external assessment data and secure APIs for data access. The technology stack includes flexible, scalable tools like MongoDB Atlas for data storage, Python or Node.js for backend services, and containerization with Docker to ensure deployment agility.

Comprehensive documentation aligned with PMBOK 7 standards supports robust project management, ensuring scope clarity, risk mitigation, quality assurance, and stakeholder engagement throughout the development lifecycle.
