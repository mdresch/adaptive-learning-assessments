**Project Summary: Adaptive Learning System**

The Adaptive Learning System project aims to revolutionize the educational experience by delivering a highly personalized, learner-centric platform primarily focused on programming and data structures education. By leveraging advanced adaptive learning algorithms—specifically Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT)—the system dynamically adjusts learning paths and challenge difficulties tailored to individual learner profiles. This approach transcends traditional one-size-fits-all education models by continuously tracking learner progress, competencies, preferences, and confidence levels to optimize learning efficiency, engagement, and mastery.

The system is designed with scalability and ethical data handling at its core, ensuring robust performance for large user bases while complying with data privacy regulations such as GDPR. It integrates comprehensive learner profiling, detailed performance analytics, and adaptive content delivery to empower learners and educators alike with actionable insights. Future enhancements include integrating external assessment data and providing secure API access to learner progress information.

Technologically, the project employs a flexible and scalable stack with options for Python or Node.js backends, MongoDB Atlas for data persistence, containerization with Docker, and rigorous version control via Git. The project follows PMBOK 7 principles for project management, with thorough documentation to ensure quality, risk management, and stakeholder engagement.
