### User Story 1: Learner Profile Management

**As a** learner,  
**I want** to create and update my personal learning profile including demographics, preferences, and prior experience  
**so that** the system can tailor the learning experience to my individual needs and accessibility requirements.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Learner can input and edit demographic details (age, education level, etc.).
- Learner can specify learning style preferences (e.g., visual, textual).
- Learner can declare prior programming experience and familiarity with data structures.
- Learner can set accessibility preferences (e.g., screen reader support).
- System securely stores and updates learner profile information.
- Changes in profile immediately influence learning path personalization.

### User Story 2: Track Learner Mastery

**As a** learner,  
**I want** the system to accurately track my mastery of programming and data structure concepts at a granular level  
**so that** I can understand my strengths and the areas I need to improve.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System logs learner interactions with activities (quizzes, coding challenges).
- System updates mastery levels for micro-competencies after each activity.
- Learner can view detailed progress reports showing mastery per concept.
- Mastery updates use Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) algorithm.
- Data is updated in near real-time after activity completion.

### User Story 3: Adaptive Challenge Selection

**As a** learner,  
**I want** the system to recommend learning activities and challenges that match my current competency level  
**so that** I am neither bored with too easy tasks nor frustrated with overly difficult ones.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System evaluates learnerâ€™s competency using BKT scores.
- Recommended activities dynamically adjust in difficulty based on competency.
- Learner receives a personalized sequence of modules and exercises.
- Learner can optionally provide feedback on challenge difficulty.
- Challenge selection adapts after each completed activity.

### User Story 4: View Data-Driven Insights

**As a** learner,  
**I want** to receive insights and analytics about my learning progress and potential improvement areas  
**so that** I can focus my efforts more effectively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Learner dashboard displays performance trends over time.
- System highlights concepts with low mastery or frequent mistakes.
- Visualizations (graphs, charts) illustrate progress and competence.
- Insights include confidence level correlations if self-reported data is available.
- Data respects privacy and is accessible only to authorized users.

---

### User Story 5: Educator Access to Learner Insights

**As an** educator or manager,  
**I want** to access aggregated performance data and insights for my learners  
**so that** I can identify common difficulties and support learner success.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Educators can view summary reports for groups or individual learners.
- Reports include mastery levels, progress trends, and challenge outcomes.
- Access is secured and role-based, ensuring learner privacy.
- Educators can export reports in common formats (CSV, PDF).
- System respects GDPR and ethical data handling in data sharing.

---

### User Story 6: Capture Self-Reported Data

**As a** learner,  
**I want** to provide self-reported data such as my confidence levels and learning goals  
**so that** the system can better personalize my learning path.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Learner can input confidence levels per topic or activity.
- Learner can set personal learning goals and priorities.
- Self-reported data influences challenge selection and content recommendations.
- System allows updating or removing self-reported data at any time.
- Data is stored securely and used in compliance with privacy policies.

---

### User Story 7: Import External Assessment Data

**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** to import external assessment data (e.g., Talent Q Dimensions reports) into learner profiles  
**so that** personalization is enriched with additional performance insights.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System supports importing assessment data files in standard formats.
- Imported data maps correctly to learner profiles and competencies.
- Data integration updates learner mastery and profile attributes.
- Admin interface provides feedback on successful or failed imports.
- Data handling complies with privacy and consent regulations.

---

### User Story 8: Secure API Access

**As a** third-party developer,  
**I want** to access learner progress and competency data through a secure API  
**so that** I can build complementary tools or integrations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- API endpoints provide read access to authorized data only.
- API uses secure authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys).
- Data returned respects learner privacy and consent.
- API documentation is available for developers.
- Rate limiting and monitoring are implemented for API usage.

---

### User Story 9: Ensure Scalability and Efficiency

**As a** system architect,  
**I want** the system to efficiently handle a large number of learners and data transactions  
**so that** performance remains stable and responsive under high load.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System design supports horizontal scaling (e.g., containerized microservices).
- Database efficiently indexes and queries learner performance data.
- Performance benchmarks demonstrate responsiveness with thousands of concurrent users.
- Monitoring tools alert on performance degradation.
- Resource usage (CPU, memory) is optimized.

---

### User Story 10: Ethical Data Handling and Consent

**As a** learner,  
**I want** to have control over my data and understand how it is used  
**so that** I can trust the system and comply with regulations like GDPR.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Learners are informed about data collection and usage policies at signup.
- System obtains explicit consent before collecting or processing personal data.
- Learners can access, correct, or delete their data.
- Data is stored and transmitted securely (encryption at rest and in transit).
- Privacy policy and terms are easily accessible.
