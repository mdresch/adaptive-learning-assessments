Based on the Adaptive Learning System project context, here are the key user roles and their specific needs:

---

### 1. Learners (End Users)
**Description:**  
Individuals using the system to learn programming and data structures concepts. They interact with learning content, challenges, and assessments.

**Needs:**  
- Personalized learning paths tailored to their current knowledge, preferences, and goals.  
- Clear visibility into their progress, mastery levels, and areas needing improvement.  
- Adaptive difficulty in challenges to maintain engagement without frustration.  
- Ability to provide self-reported data such as confidence levels and learning goals.  
- Accessibility accommodations based on their individual needs.  
- Secure handling of their personal and learning data with privacy assurances.  
- Intuitive and friendly user interface for easy navigation and interaction.

---

### 2. Educators / Instructors
**Description:**  
Teachers or trainers who oversee learner progress and may intervene or guide learning.

**Needs:**  
- Access to data-driven insights on learner performance and mastery to identify who needs help or challenge adjustments.  
- Tools to monitor learner progress at both individual and group levels.  
- Ability to understand and trust the adaptive systemâ€™s recommendations and competency assessments.  
- Integration of external assessment data to enrich learner profiles.  
- Control or oversight capabilities to adjust content or learning paths if needed.

---

### 3. Content Developers / Instructional Designers
**Description:**  
Professionals responsible for creating and curating learning modules, challenges, and assessments.

**Needs:**  
- Clear data models and feedback on how content performs in the adaptive system (e.g., difficulty levels, learner success rates).  
- Ability to tag and map content to specific micro-competencies for accurate BKT modeling.  
- Tools or APIs to upload, update, and manage learning materials and metadata.  
- Insights into learner engagement and challenge effectiveness to improve or adapt content.

---

### 4. Data Scientists / Algorithm Engineers
**Description:**  
Experts developing and maintaining the core adaptive algorithms (e.g., Bayesian Knowledge Tracing engine) and data models.

**Needs:**  
- Access to rich, granular learner interaction data to train and validate adaptive models.  
- Tools to update and refine the BKT model and challenge selection logic.  
- Integration capabilities for external assessments and self-reported data.  
- Performance metrics and logs to monitor algorithm accuracy and adaptivity effectiveness.  
- Secure and efficient data pipelines for handling large-scale datasets.

---

### 5. System Administrators / DevOps
**Description:**  
Personnel responsible for deployment, maintenance, scalability, and security of the system infrastructure.

**Needs:**  
- Tools for managing configuration, environment variables (e.g., MongoDB Atlas URI), and deployment pipelines (Docker).  
- Monitoring tools for system health, performance, and scalability.  
- Security and privacy controls to ensure data protection and regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR).  
- Backup and recovery mechanisms for databases and critical services.  
- Access control management for users and roles within the system.

---

### 6. Project Managers / Stakeholders
**Description:**  
Individuals overseeing the project delivery, timelines, resources, and stakeholder communication.

**Needs:**  
- Visibility into project progress, risks, and quality metrics.  
- Updates on feature development status, challenges, and milestones.  
- Documentation and reporting aligned with PMBOK 7 standards.  
- Feedback loops from users and developers to adjust project scope or priorities.  
- Assurance that ethical guidelines and data privacy practices are upheld.
