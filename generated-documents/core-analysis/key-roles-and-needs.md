Based on the Adaptive Learning System project context, here are the key user roles and their specific needs:

---

### 1. **Learners**
**Description:**  
Primary end-users of the system who engage with the learning content to improve their programming and data structure skills.

**Needs:**
- Personalized learning paths tailored to their current competency, learning style, and goals.
- Clear visibility into their progression and mastery of specific skills.
- Adaptive challenges that match their skill level to maintain engagement and maximize learning.
- Ability to input self-reported data such as confidence levels and learning goals.
- Accessible and user-friendly interface accommodating various accessibility needs.
- Data privacy and control over their personal and performance data.
- Feedback and insights that help identify strengths and weaknesses.

### 2. **Educators / Instructors / Mentors**
**Description:**  
Individuals who guide learners, design learning programs, or monitor learner progress.

**Needs:**
- Access to detailed learner progress and mastery reports to tailor instruction or interventions.
- Insights into class or cohort-level performance to identify common challenges or content gaps.
- Tools to integrate external assessment data (e.g., Talent Q Dimensions) for a richer understanding of learners.
- Ability to view historical performance and trends over time.
- Secure and ethical access to learner data respecting privacy regulations.
- Optionally, ability to customize or suggest learning paths or content.
