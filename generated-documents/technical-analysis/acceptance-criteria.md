# Acceptance Criteria for Adaptive Learning System

---

## 1. Learner Profile Management

**AC1.1:** The system shall allow creation of a learner profile including demographics (age, gender, location), learning preferences (visual, auditory, kinesthetic), prior experience in programming/data structures, and accessibility needs.

**AC1.2:** The system shall enable updating and deleting learner profile information securely.

**AC1.3:** The system shall validate all input fields for correctness (e.g., valid age range, supported learning preferences).

**AC1.4:** The system shall store learner profile data in MongoDB with appropriate indexing for efficient retrieval.

**AC1.5:** The system shall ensure that learner profile data is only accessible to authorized users and services.

---

## 2. Performance Tracking & Logging

**AC2.1:** The system shall log learner interactions in real-time or near-real-time, including activity types (quiz, coding challenge, interactive exercise), timestamps, scores, attempts, and user actions.

**AC2.2:** All logged data shall be stored persistently in the database for historical analysis.

**AC2.3:** The system shall handle high volumes of concurrent activity logs without data loss or performance degradation.

**AC2.4:** The system shall provide an interface (API or UI) for learners to view their past activities and performance history.

---

## 3. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) Engine

**AC3.1:** The system shall implement a BKT model that maintains probabilistic mastery estimates for each micro-competency per learner.

**AC3.2:** The BKT engine shall update competency probabilities automatically based on learner performance data after every relevant activity.

**AC3.3:** The BKT model shall support parameter customization (e.g., slip, guess probabilities) for each micro-competency.

**AC3.4:** Updates to learner mastery shall be consistent, accurate, and reflect the latest interaction data without significant latency.

**AC3.5:** The BKT computations shall be thoroughly unit tested with edge cases to ensure reliability.

---

## 4. Adaptive Content and Challenge Delivery

**AC4.1:** The system shall select and recommend learning modules, lessons, and challenges dynamically based on the learner’s current competency profile.

**AC4.2:** The difficulty of recommended challenges shall be optimally matched to the learner’s mastery level to maximize engagement and learning efficiency.

**AC4.3:** The system shall adapt the learning path in real-time as learner competency changes.

**AC4.4:** The content selection logic shall allow configuring business rules and thresholds for adaptation.

**AC4.5:** Learners shall be able to override recommendations and manually select content if desired.

---

## 5. Data-Driven Insights

**AC5.1:** The system shall provide dashboards or reports showing learner progress, mastery levels across competencies, recent activity summaries, and areas needing improvement.

**AC5.2:** Insights shall be available to both learners and authorized educators/managers, with role-based access control.

**AC5.3:** Data visualizations shall be clear, intuitive, and updated in near-real-time.

**AC5.4:** The system shall allow exporting insights data in common formats (CSV, JSON).

---

## 6. Scalability and Efficiency

**AC6.1:** The system shall support concurrent usage by thousands of learners without performance degradation.

**AC6.2:** The database schema and indexing strategy shall support efficient querying and aggregation of large datasets.

**AC6.3:** The system shall be containerized (Docker) and support horizontal scaling of backend services.

**AC6.4:** All API endpoints shall respond within acceptable latency limits (e.g., <500ms under normal load).

---

## 7. Ethical Data Handling and Privacy

**AC7.1:** The system shall implement strong authentication and authorization ensuring only authorized access to learner data.

**AC7.2:** All personal data shall be stored and transmitted encrypted (at rest and in transit).

**AC7.3:** The system shall provide mechanisms for learners to give informed consent for data collection and usage.

**AC7.4:** The system shall allow learners to request data export and data deletion in compliance with GDPR.

**AC7.5:** Audit logs shall be maintained for data access and modifications.

---

## 8. Self-Reported Data Integration

**AC8.1:** The system shall allow learners to input self-reported data such as confidence levels and learning goals.

**AC8.2:** Self-reported data shall be integrated into learner profiles and considered in adaptive logic where applicable.

**AC8.3:** The system shall validate and store self-reported data securely.

---

## 9. API for Data Access (Future Feature)

**AC9.1:** The system shall provide a secure RESTful API for accessing learner progress and competency data, with authentication and authorization.

**AC9.2:** API endpoints shall support filtering and pagination for efficient data retrieval.

**AC9.3:** API documentation shall be provided (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger specification).

---

## 10. Installation and Setup

**AC10.1:** The system repository shall include clear instructions for environment setup, dependency installation, and configuration.

**AC10.2:** Environment variables (e.g., `MONGODB_URI`) must be configurable and documented.

**AC10.3:** The system shall provide utility scripts for initial setup tasks (e.g., importing users, running BKT updates).

**AC10.4:** All scripts shall handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful logs.

---

## 11. Testing and Quality Assurance

**AC11.1:** The system shall include automated unit and integration tests covering all core functionalities.

**AC11.2:** Tests shall cover edge cases, error handling, and performance scenarios.

**AC11.3:** Code coverage reports shall be generated and maintained at a minimum threshold (e.g., 80%).

**AC11.4:** Continuous integration pipelines shall run tests on every commit/pull request.
