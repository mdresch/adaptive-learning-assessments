# Project Charter  
**Adaptive Learning System**

---

## 1. Project Purpose and Business Justification  
Traditional educational methods often apply a one-size-fits-all approach that fails to address individual learner needs, potentially limiting engagement and mastery. The Adaptive Learning System project aims to revolutionize the educational experience by delivering personalized, learner-centric content specifically targeting programming and data structures concepts. By dynamically adjusting learning paths and challenges based on real-time learner data, the system will maximize learning efficiency and outcomes.

This project addresses critical market needs for personalized education technology, with potential ROI through improved learning outcomes, reduced training costs, and scalable educational delivery. The business case is supported by extensive stakeholder analysis and market research demonstrating demand for adaptive learning solutions in technical education. This aligns with broader business goals to innovate educational technologies, improve learner outcomes, and position the organization as a leader in adaptive education solutions.

## 4. High-Level Assumptions and Constraints  

### Assumptions  
- Access to accurate and comprehensive learner data will be available and consented for use.  
- The development team will finalize backend technology choice (Python or Node.js) early in the project and maintain expertise.  
- MongoDB Atlas will provide a reliable and scalable database solution as planned.  
- External assessment integration and API features will be scoped as future enhancements beyond initial release.  
- Stakeholders will provide timely feedback during development phases.  

### Constraints  
- GDPR and other privacy regulations impose strict data handling and consent requirements.  
- Project budget and timeline limit scope to core adaptive features for initial release, with some features deferred.  
- Integration of external assessment data and API access are planned for future phases and not included in initial delivery.  
- Dependence on third-party services such as MongoDB Atlas and cloud infrastructure availability.  
- Potential technology stack uncertainty until final backend framework decision is made.
