# Project Charter  
**Adaptive Learning System**

---

## 1. Project Purpose and Business Justification  
Traditional educational methods often apply a one-size-fits-all approach that fails to address individual learner needs, potentially limiting engagement and mastery. The Adaptive Learning System project aims to revolutionize the educational experience by delivering personalized, learner-centric content specifically targeting programming and data structures concepts. By dynamically adjusting learning paths and challenges based on real-time learner data, the system will maximize learning efficiency, engagement, and mastery. This aligns with broader business goals to innovate educational technologies, improve learner outcomes, and position the organization as a leader in adaptive education solutions.

## 3. High-Level Requirements  

- Comprehensive learner profile management including demographics, preferences, and accessibility needs.  
- Detailed logging of learner interactions across quizzes, coding challenges, and interactive exercises.  
- Integration of a Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) engine for real-time competency estimation.  
- Adaptive content delivery engine for personalized module and challenge recommendations.  
- Secure data storage and API endpoints supporting future integration of external assessments and self-reported learner data.  
- Robust data privacy, security, and consent management aligned with GDPR.  
- Scalable backend infrastructure capable of handling large datasets and concurrent users.  
- Containerized deployment using Docker and version-controlled codebase.  

---

## 4. High-Level Assumptions and Constraints  

### Assumptions  
- Access to accurate and comprehensive learner data will be available and consented for use.  
- The development team will finalize backend technology choice (Python or Node.js) early in the project and maintain expertise.  
- MongoDB Atlas will provide a reliable and scalable database solution as planned.  
- External assessment integration and API features will be scoped as future enhancements beyond initial release.  
- Stakeholders will provide timely feedback during development phases.  

### Constraints  
- GDPR and other privacy regulations impose strict data handling and consent requirements.  
- Project budget and timeline limit scope to core adaptive features for initial release, with some features deferred.  
- Integration of external assessment data and API access are planned for future phases and not included in initial delivery.  
- Dependence on third-party services such as MongoDB Atlas and cloud infrastructure availability.  
- Potential technology stack uncertainty until final backend framework decision is made.
