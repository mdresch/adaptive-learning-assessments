# Adaptive Learning System  
## Scope Management Plan  
*Aligned with PMBOK 7th Edition Standards*

---

### 1. Introduction  
This Scope Management Plan defines how the scope of the Adaptive Learning System project will be developed, monitored, controlled, and validated throughout the project lifecycle. It ensures clear boundaries, prevents scope creep, and aligns with the project charter and stakeholder expectations.

---

### 2. Scope Definition

#### 2.1 Scope Planning  
- The project scope will be defined by analyzing the project charter, stakeholder requirements, and business needs documented in the project overview.  
- Detailed requirements will be gathered through stakeholder interviews, workshops, and review of existing educational frameworks.  
- The preliminary scope description from the charter will be expanded into a comprehensive Project Scope Statement.  

#### 2.2 Project Scope Statement Preparation  
- The Scope Statement will include:  
  - Project objectives and goals (e.g., personalized learning paths, mastery tracking, adaptive challenge selection).  
  - Deliverables (e.g., learner profile management, BKT engine, adaptive content delivery).  
  - Project boundaries (in-scope and out-of-scope items, e.g., future features like external assessment integration explicitly noted as phased).  
  - Acceptance criteria for deliverables.  
  - Assumptions and constraints (technology stack, data privacy regulations like GDPR).  
- The Scope Statement will be documented in the `./docs/scope_statement.md` and reviewed/approved by key stakeholders, including the Project Sponsor, Product Owner, and Lead Developers.

### 3. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

#### 3.1 WBS Creation  
- The WBS will decompose the project deliverables and work into manageable components.  
- Using a deliverable-oriented approach, the WBS will break down major features such as:  
  - Learner Profile Management Module  
  - Performance Tracking System  
  - Bayesian Knowledge Tracing Engine  
  - Adaptive Content Delivery Logic  
  - API Development (future phase)  
  - Data Privacy and Security Implementation  
  - Testing and Quality Assurance  
- Each WBS element will be detailed enough to allow for accurate estimation, assignment, and control.  
- Tools such as WBS software or spreadsheets will be used to maintain the structure, linked to project schedules and resource assignments.

#### 3.2 WBS Dictionary  
- Each WBS element will have an associated WBS Dictionary entry detailing:  
  - Description of the work  
  - Deliverables  
  - Responsible parties  
  - Milestones  
  - Quality requirements  
  - Acceptance criteria  
- The WBS Dictionary will be maintained in the `./docs/wbs_dictionary.xlsx` or equivalent document repository.  
- Updates require review and approval from the Project Manager and relevant technical leads to ensure consistency and clarity.

---

### 4. Scope Validation

#### 4.1 Deliverables Verification and Acceptance  
- Deliverables will be verified against acceptance criteria defined in the Scope Statement and WBS Dictionary.  
- Formal reviews and inspections will be conducted at agreed milestones (e.g., completion of core modules, integration phases).  
- Stakeholders (including product owners, SMEs, and end-user representatives) will participate in acceptance reviews.  
- Deliverable acceptance will be documented via sign-off forms or electronic approval workflows stored in project document management systems.  

#### 4.2 Validation Process  
- Use of test cases aligned with requirements to verify functionality.  
- Demonstrations and walkthroughs during sprint reviews or phase gates.  
- Feedback incorporation and re-validation for any identified gaps before formal acceptance.

---

### 5. Scope Control

#### 5.1 Scope Change Management Process  
- Any proposed changes to project scope, including additions, deletions, or modifications, must be submitted via a formal Change Request form.  
- Change Requests will be logged and tracked in a Change Log maintained in `./docs/change_log.xlsx` or project management software.  
- The Change Control Board (CCB), comprising the Project Manager, Product Owner, key technical leads, and sponsor representatives, will evaluate each request for impact on schedule, cost, quality, and risk.  
- Approved changes will result in updates to the Scope Statement, WBS, and related project baselines with corresponding communication to all stakeholders.  
- Rejected changes will be documented with rationale and communicated to the requester.  
- Emergency changes will follow an expedited but documented approval process.

#### 5.2 Preventing Scope Creep  
- Continuous scope monitoring through regular status meetings and reviews.  
- Clear communication of scope boundaries to all team members and stakeholders.  
- Integration of scope verification activities in project schedule to detect deviations early.

---

### 8. Alignment with Project Charter

- The scope management plan aligns with the project charter objectives, goals, and constraints, ensuring that all work contributes directly to delivering the adaptive learning system as envisioned.  
- Ethical data handling and scalability requirements are explicitly included in scope definition and control processes.  
- Future-phase features are clearly scoped to manage stakeholder expectations and phased delivery.
