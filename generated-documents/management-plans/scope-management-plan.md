# Scope Management Plan for Adaptive Learning System Project

---

## 1. Introduction

This Scope Management Plan defines how the project scope for the Adaptive Learning System (ALS) will be defined, validated, controlled, and managed throughout the project lifecycle. It aligns with PMBOKÂ® Guide 7th Edition principles and ensures that the project delivers all agreed-upon features within time, budget, and quality constraints.

---

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of this plan is to provide a structured approach to:

- Clearly define the project scope and deliverables
- Establish a process for scope verification and validation
- Manage scope changes and control scope creep
- Ensure stakeholder requirements are met within project constraints

---

## 3. Project Overview (Summary)

The Adaptive Learning System project aims to build a sophisticated platform to personalize learning paths primarily for programming and data structures education. The system dynamically adjusts content and challenges based on learner progress, preferences, and skill mastery to optimize learning outcomes.

---

## 4. Scope Description

### 4.1 Product Scope

The ALS will provide the following major capabilities and features:

- **Learner Profile Management:** Capture detailed learner demographics, preferences, prior experience, and accessibility needs.
- **Performance Tracking:** Log detailed learner interactions, completion records, scoring, and attempts within various activities.
- **BKT Engine:** Implement Bayesian Knowledge Tracing to assess and update learner competencies at micro-competency level.
- **Adaptive Challenge Delivery:** Dynamically recommend learning modules and challenges based on learner competency.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Provide dashboards and reports on learner progress, mastery, and areas needing improvement.
- **Ethical Data Handling:** Incorporate privacy, security, and consent mechanisms compliant with GDPR and other relevant regulations.
- **Scalability:** Architect system to efficiently support a large user base and vast data volume.
- **Future Integrations:**
  - External assessment data (e.g., Talent Q Dimensions)
  - Secure API access for learner progress data

### 4.2 Project Deliverables

- Functional ALS backend with API endpoints (Python or Node.js)
- MongoDB Atlas database schema and data models
- Bayesian Knowledge Tracing core algorithms
- Adaptive recommendation engine logic
- Data privacy and security implementation
- Project documentation aligned with PMBOK 7 principles
- Scripts for data import, BKT updates, and database setup
- Test suites for core components
- Containerized deployment (Docker)

## 6. Requirements Management

### 6.1 Requirements Identification

- Requirements will be gathered from stakeholders including learners, educators, project sponsors, and technical teams.
- Requirements will be documented in the Project Requirements Specification (PRS) maintained in the `./docs` directory.
- Use user stories, use cases, and acceptance criteria to capture functional and non-functional requirements.

### 6.2 Requirements Traceability

- A Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) will be maintained to map requirements to design, implementation, and testing artifacts.
- RTM will help verify that all requirements are addressed and validated.

---

## 7. Scope Definition Process

- Develop a detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) decomposing the project into manageable components.
- The WBS will be created collaboratively with stakeholders and technical leads.
- Define acceptance criteria for each deliverable and work package.
- Document assumptions, constraints, and dependencies.

---

## 8. Scope Verification

- Formal acceptance of deliverables by the project sponsor and key stakeholders.
- Verification activities include reviews, inspections, walkthroughs, and testing against acceptance criteria.
- Use Project Management Information System (PMIS) or collaboration tools to track verification status.
- Conduct formal scope validation meetings at the end of each major phase or milestone.

---

## 9. Scope Control

### 9.1 Change Control Process

- All change requests impacting project scope must be submitted via the Change Request Form.
- Changes will be reviewed by the Change Control Board (CCB), consisting of project manager, technical leads, and key stakeholders.
- Approved changes will be documented and baseline scope updated accordingly.
- Changes will be assessed for impact on schedule, cost, quality, and resources before approval.

### 9.2 Scope Creep Prevention

- Regular scope reviews during status meetings.
- Clear communication of scope boundaries to all team members and stakeholders.
- Early identification of potential scope changes and risks.
