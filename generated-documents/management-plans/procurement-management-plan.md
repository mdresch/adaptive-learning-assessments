### 7. Procurement Approach & Strategy

- **Make-or-Buy Analysis:** The project favors using open-source and in-house development for core components (e.g., BKT engine, backend logic). Procurement will focus on third-party services (e.g., database hosting, security tools) and specialized consulting only if internal capabilities are insufficient.  
- **Competitive Bidding:** For significant procurements (e.g., database hosting plans, consulting services), competitive bidding with at least three vendors will be sought to ensure value.  
- **Preferred Vendors:** MongoDB Atlas is the preferred database vendor due to scalability and prior selection. Docker as containerization technology is open-source; however, paid support may be procured if needed.  
- **Contract Types:** Fixed-price contracts will be preferred for software licenses and cloud services. Time and materials or service-level agreements may be used for consulting and support services.  
- **Ethical and Legal Compliance:** All procurements will mandate vendor compliance with GDPR and other relevant data security regulations.
