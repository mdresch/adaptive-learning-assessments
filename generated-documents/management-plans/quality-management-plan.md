# Quality Management Plan for Adaptive Learning System

---

## 1. Introduction

The purpose of this Quality Management Plan (QMP) is to define the quality standards, procedures, roles, and responsibilities necessary to ensure that the Adaptive Learning System project meets its quality objectives. This plan aligns with the PMBOK Guide 7th Edition principles and integrates with the overall Project Management Plan.

## 2. Quality Objectives

The Adaptive Learning System aims to deliver a high-quality, scalable, and secure personalized learning platform. The quality objectives are:

- **Functionality:** Deliver all core features as defined in the scope, including adaptive learning paths, Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) engine, and data-driven insights.
- **Performance:** Ensure system responsiveness and scalability to support a large number of users concurrently without degradation.
- **Reliability:** Provide a stable and error-free user experience with minimal downtime.
- **Usability:** Design an intuitive and accessible user interface accommodating diverse learner needs.
- **Security & Data Privacy:** Comply with GDPR and ethical data handling guidelines to protect user data.
- **Maintainability:** Ensure the system is modular and well-documented to facilitate future enhancements and maintenance.
- **Compliance:** Adhere to organizational, legal, and regulatory requirements related to educational technology and data privacy.

## 5. Quality Management Approach

### 5.1 Quality Planning

- Define acceptance criteria for all deliverables in the project scope.
- Develop detailed test cases and scenarios covering functional, integration, system, performance, security, and usability testing.
- Establish coding standards and guidelines for all developers.
- Define data validation rules for all learner data inputs and outputs.
- Prepare security policies aligned with GDPR and other regulatory frameworks.

### 5.2 Quality Assurance

- Conduct regular code reviews using pull requests and static analysis tools.
- Perform continuous integration and automated testing (unit, integration, regression).
- Maintain a traceability matrix linking requirements to test cases.
- Schedule periodic quality audits and process reviews.
- Use test environments that mirror production configurations for accurate testing.
- Implement security assessments including vulnerability scanning and penetration tests.

### 5.3 Quality Control

- Execute planned test cases and document results.
- Track defects and issues using a centralized issue tracking system.
- Monitor performance metrics continuously with automated tools.
- Validate data accuracy through automated checks and manual reviews.
- Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with representative learners and educators.
- Review logs and audit trails to detect anomalies or data inconsistencies.
- Confirm compliance with data privacy and security requirements before releases.

## 6. Quality Tools and Techniques

- **Automated Testing Frameworks:** Pytest, Jest, Selenium for end-to-end tests.
- **Static Code Analysis:** SonarQube, ESLint, Pylint.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or equivalent.
- **Performance Testing:** Apache JMeter, Locust.
- **Security Testing:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.
- **Issue Tracking:** Jira, GitHub Issues.
- **Documentation:** Pydantic/Mongoose schemas for data validation; detailed inline code comments.
