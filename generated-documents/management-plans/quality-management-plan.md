- Deliver a reliable, scalable, and secure adaptive learning platform that personalizes learning paths effectively.
- Ensure 99.9% system uptime and responsiveness under expected user loads.
- Adhere strictly to data privacy, security, and ethical standards including GDPR compliance.
- Achieve at least 95% accuracy in learner competency assessments via the Bayesian Knowledge Tracing engine.
- Maintain high user satisfaction with intuitive user interfaces and minimal defects.
- Ensure all software releases pass defined quality gates before deployment.

## 5. Quality Management Approach  

### 5.1 Quality Planning  
- Define quality requirements early with stakeholders.  
- Document acceptance criteria for features and components.  
- Develop test plans, test cases, and quality checklists.  
- Establish coding standards and documentation guidelines.  
- Setup automated testing frameworks (unit, integration, system, and security tests).  

### 5.2 Quality Assurance (QA)  
- Conduct periodic process audits and reviews to ensure compliance with defined procedures and standards.  
- Continuous monitoring of project performance through quality metrics (defect density, test coverage, mean time to resolve issues).  
- Facilitate regular code reviews and static code analysis to maintain code quality.  
- Validate compliance with GDPR and other regulatory requirements through audits.  

### 5.3 Quality Control (QC)  
- Perform rigorous testing at multiple levels:  
  - Unit Testing: Developers test individual components.  
  - Integration Testing: Verify interaction between modules (e.g., API and BKT engine).  
  - System Testing: End-to-end testing of the adaptive learning system.  
  - User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Stakeholder validation of features.  
  - Performance and Load Testing: Validate scalability and responsiveness.  
  - Security Testing: Penetration tests, vulnerability scans.  
- Use defect tracking tools (e.g., Jira) to log, track, and resolve defects.  
- Implement regression testing before each release to ensure no new defects introduced.

## 6. Quality Metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  

| Metric                          | Description                                      | Target/Threshold                         |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Defect Density                 | Number of defects per 1,000 lines of code      | < 1 defect per 1,000 LOC                |
| Test Coverage                 | Percentage of code covered by automated tests  | ≥ 80%                                   |
| Requirements Coverage         | Percentage of requirements tested               | 100%                                   |
| Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)    | Average time to find defects                     | < 2 days                               |
