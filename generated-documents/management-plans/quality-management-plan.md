## 1. Introduction  
This Quality Management Plan (QMP) defines the quality policies, procedures, and responsibilities for the Adaptive Learning System project, ensuring that the final product meets or exceeds stakeholder expectations and complies with relevant standards and regulations. This plan aligns with the PMBOK 7th Edition principles emphasizing value delivery, stakeholder engagement, and continuous improvement.

## 2. Quality Objectives, Standards, and Metrics  

### 2.1 Quality Objectives  
- Deliver a fully functional Adaptive Learning System that personalizes learning paths with at least 95% accuracy in learner competency assessment.  
- Ensure system uptime of 99.9% post-deployment to support scalability and availability.  
- Achieve 100% compliance with GDPR and ethical data handling policies.  
- Maintain code quality with <5% defect density in released builds.  
- Achieve ≥90% customer satisfaction rating for usability and performance in pilot testing.  
- Ensure all critical features pass acceptance criteria before deployment.

### 2.2 Quality Standards  
- **Software Development:** Follow industry best practices (e.g., Clean Code, SOLID principles).  
- **Security:** Comply with GDPR, OWASP Top 10, and data privacy policies.  
- **Testing:** Adhere to IEEE 829 standards for software test documentation.  
- **Documentation:** Use PMBOK 7-aligned documentation standards and maintain traceability.  
- **Project Management:** Follow PMBOK 7 guidelines for quality management and continuous improvement.

### 2.3 Quality Metrics  
| Metric                         | Target/Threshold              | Measurement Frequency        | Responsible Party        |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Defect Density (defects/KLOC) | ≤ 5 defects per 1000 lines    | Per sprint/release           | QA Lead                 |
| Test Coverage                 | ≥ 80% automated test coverage| Per build                   | QA Team                 |
| System Uptime                 | ≥ 99.9%                      | Monthly                     | Operations Team         |
| GDPR Compliance Incidents     | 0                            | Continuous monitoring       | Compliance Officer      |
| Customer Satisfaction Score  | ≥ 90%                        | Post-pilot, post-release    | PM/Customer Relations   |
| On-Time Delivery of Features | ≥ 90% on schedule            | Sprint/release delivery     | Project Manager         |

## 3. Quality Assurance Procedures and Activities  

- **Process Audits:** Conduct regular audits on development and testing processes to ensure adherence to defined standards and procedures.  
- **Peer Reviews and Code Reviews:** Mandatory peer reviews for all source code and documentation before merging to main branches.  
- **Standards Compliance Checks:** Periodic checks to ensure compliance with GDPR, security policies, and coding standards.  
- **Training and Awareness:** Provide ongoing training on quality standards, tools, and ethical data handling for all project team members.  
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Implement automated build and test pipelines to detect defects early.  
- **Configuration Management:** Strict version control usage (Git) to maintain code integrity and traceability.

---

## 4. Quality Control Processes and Checkpoints  

- **Requirement Verification:** Validate that all requirements are testable and traceable.  
- **Unit Testing:** Developers to perform thorough unit tests on all new and changed code with defined coverage targets.  
- **Integration Testing:** Verify interoperability between components (e.g., API, BKT engine, database).  
- **System Testing:** End-to-end testing including functionality, usability, performance, security, and compliance.  
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Engage selected stakeholders/learners to validate system usability and feature completeness.  
- **Defect Tracking and Resolution:** Use a centralized defect tracking tool with defined severity and priority levels, monitored regularly.  
- **Code Quality Analysis:** Use automated tools (e.g., SonarQube) to enforce code quality standards.

## 5. Testing Strategies and Acceptance Criteria  

### 5.1 Testing Strategies  
- **Automated Testing:** Unit tests, integration tests, and regression tests automated using frameworks compatible with Python and Node.js.  
- **Manual Testing:** Exploratory testing, usability testing, and accessibility assessments.  
- **Performance Testing:** Load and stress tests to validate scalability under large learner volume scenarios.  
- **Security Testing:** Vulnerability scanning, penetration testing focusing on data privacy and API security.  
- **Compliance Testing:** Verify GDPR compliance and ethical data handling implementations.

### 5.2 Acceptance Criteria  
- All critical and high-priority defects resolved or mitigated before release.  
- ≥ 90% test case pass rate across all test phases.  
- Successful demonstration of personalization accuracy with Bayesian Knowledge Tracing within defined thresholds.  
- Stakeholder sign-off obtained after UAT confirming system meets functional and non-functional requirements.  
- Documentation complete and reviewed.

## 6. Quality Improvement Processes and Continuous Improvement  

- **Lessons Learned Sessions:** Conduct at major milestones and post-deployment to identify improvement opportunities.  
- **Root Cause Analysis:** For major defects or process failures, analyze causes and implement corrective actions.  
- **Process Refinement:** Regularly update development, testing, and QA processes based on feedback and performance data.  
- **Continuous Feedback Loop:** Collect feedback from stakeholders and end-users to guide iterative improvements.  
- **Metrics Monitoring:** Use quality metrics dashboards to identify trends and areas for improvement.
