## 5. Resource Management Approach

### 5.1 Resource Allocation & Scheduling

- Use of project management tools (e.g., MS Project, Jira) to assign tasks aligned with team members’ expertise and availability.
- Weekly resource capacity reviews to identify bottlenecks or underutilization.
- Agile sprints (2 weeks) with planned resource commitments and retrospectives.

### 5.2 Resource Tracking and Reporting

- Maintain resource utilization logs within project management tools.
- Regular status meetings to update resource allocation and address conflicts.
- Use of timesheets or effort tracking tools as required by organizational policy.

### 5.3 Training and Development

- Identify skill gaps through periodic assessments.
- Provide training on:
  - Latest backend frameworks (FastAPI/Express.js).
  - Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and adaptive learning algorithms.
  - Data privacy and security compliance.
  - PMBOK and Agile best practices.
- Encourage knowledge sharing sessions within the team.

### 5.4 Conflict Resolution

- Escalate resource conflicts to Project Manager.
- Prioritize critical path activities.
- Use negotiation and reallocation strategies to resolve conflicts.

---

## 6. Resource Optimization Strategies

- Cross-train team members to allow flexibility in task assignments.
- Leverage reusable code components and scripts (e.g., import_users.js, bkt_update.py).
- Automate routine tasks such as testing and deployment using CI/CD pipelines.
- Use containerization (Docker) to standardize development and deployment environments, reducing setup times.

## 7. Resource Risk Management

| Risk                         | Impact                            | Mitigation Strategy                                             |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Key personnel turnover        | Project delays, knowledge loss  | Documentation, knowledge transfer, maintain bench of potential contractors |
| Skill shortages               | Delayed deliverables            | Early identification, training, hiring external experts         |
| Resource over-allocation      | Burnout, reduced productivity   | Regular workload assessments, realistic scheduling              |
| Infrastructure failures      | Service downtime, data loss     | Use cloud provider SLAs, backups, disaster recovery plans       |
| Security breaches            | Data loss, compliance violations| Regular security audits, access control, encryption practices   |
