## 5. Resource Management Approach  

### 5.1 Resource Allocation  
- Resources will be allocated based on project phases and deliverables. Initial focus on backend and data science resources to develop core adaptive engine and data models.  
- Resource leveling will be applied to avoid overallocation. Priority tasks assigned to critical roles first.  
- Resource assignments will be tracked in project management tools (e.g., Jira, MS Project).  

### 5.2 Resource Monitoring and Control  
- Weekly resource status meetings to review workload, progress, and any resource constraints.  
- Timesheets or effort logs will be maintained to track actual resource utilization against estimates.  
- Adjust resource allocation dynamically in response to risks, schedule changes, or performance issues.  

### 5.3 Training and Development  
- Provide training on new technologies (e.g., MongoDB, FastAPI/Node.js) and methodologies (BKT, Agile).  
- Conduct knowledge-sharing sessions among team members to build cross-functional capabilities.  
- Encourage participation in relevant webinars, workshops, and certifications.
