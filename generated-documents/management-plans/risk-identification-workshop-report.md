## Risk Assessment Methodology

### Probability Assessment Criteria
Risks were assessed using the following probability scale:
- **Very Low (1):** <10% chance of occurrence
- **Low (2):** 10-30% chance of occurrence
- **Moderate (3):** 31-60% chance of occurrence
- **High (4):** 61-85% chance of occurrence
- **Very High (5):** >85% chance of occurrence

### Impact Assessment Criteria
Impact was evaluated across four dimensions:
- **Schedule Impact:** Effect on project timeline
- **Budget Impact:** Financial implications
- **Scope Impact:** Effect on project deliverables
- **Quality Impact:** Effect on system performance and user experience

### Risk Scoring Matrix
| Impact/Probability | Very Low (1) | Low (2) | Moderate (3) | High (4) | Very High (5) |
|-------------------|--------------|---------|--------------|----------|---------------|
| **Catastrophic (5)** | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 |
