# Risk Management Plan for Adaptive Learning System Project

---

## 1. Introduction

This Risk Management Plan defines the approach, processes, and tools to identify, analyze, respond to, and monitor risks throughout the Adaptive Learning System project lifecycle. The goal is to minimize negative impacts and maximize opportunities to ensure successful delivery aligned with project objectives.

---

## 2. Project Overview

The Adaptive Learning System project aims to develop a personalized, scalable educational platform leveraging Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) to tailor learning experiences for programming and data structures learners. The system will prioritize data privacy and scalability, integrating complex algorithms and multiple technology stacks.

## 7. Risk Analysis and Evaluation

### 7.1 Risk Probability and Impact Scales

| Likelihood | Description                          |
|------------|------------------------------------|
| Very High  | > 80% chance                       |
| High       | 60% - 80%                         |
| Medium     | 30% - 60%                         |
| Low        | 10% - 30%                         |
| Very Low   | < 10%                            |

| Impact         | Description                                     |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Very High      | Critical impact on project success, >25% cost increase, major delay (>2 months), scope loss |
| High           | Significant impact, 15-25% cost increase, delay 1-2 months, compromised quality |
| Medium         | Moderate impact, 5-15% cost increase, delay 2-4 weeks, minor quality issues |
| Low            | Minor impact, <5% cost increase, negligible delay or quality impact |
| Very Low       | Insignificant impact                            |

### 7.2 Risk Scoring and Prioritization

- Risk Score = Likelihood * Impact (numeric scale)
