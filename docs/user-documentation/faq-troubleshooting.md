## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

#### Q: What is the Adaptive Learning System?
**A:** The Adaptive Learning System is a personalized educational platform that uses Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) to adapt learning content to individual student needs. It focuses on programming and data structures education, providing customized learning paths based on your competency levels and learning preferences.

#### Q: How does the adaptive algorithm work?
**A:** The system uses Bayesian Knowledge Tracing to probabilistically assess your mastery of specific skills (micro-competencies). As you complete activities, the algorithm updates your competency scores and adjusts the difficulty and type of content recommended to you. This ensures you're always working at an optimal challenge level.

#### Q: Is the platform free to use?
**A:** Access depends on your institution's subscription. Students typically access the platform through their educational institution. Contact your instructor or institution's IT department for access information.

#### Q: What programming languages are supported?
**A:** The platform currently supports:
- Python (primary focus)
- Java
- C++
- JavaScript
- Additional languages may be available based on course content

#### Q: Can I use the platform on mobile devices?
**A:** Yes! The platform offers:
- Responsive web interface for mobile browsers
- Native mobile apps for iOS and Android
- Offline content download for studying without internet
- Progress synchronization across all devices

### Learning and Progress

#### Q: How are competency scores calculated?
**A:** Competency scores (0-10 scale) are calculated using Bayesian Knowledge Tracing based on:
- Your performance on activities and assessments
- Time taken to complete tasks
- Number of attempts and hints used
- Self-reported confidence levels
- Historical learning patterns

**Score Interpretation:**
- 0-3: Beginner (foundational work needed)
- 4-6: Developing (building understanding)
- 7-8: Proficient (solid grasp)
- 9-10: Expert (mastery achieved)

#### Q: Why isn't my progress saving?
**A:** Common causes and solutions:
1. **Internet connectivity**: Ensure stable connection
2. **Browser issues**: Clear cache and cookies
3. **Incomplete activities**: Complete all required steps
4. **Session timeout**: Log out and back in
5. **JavaScript disabled**: Enable JavaScript in browser

#### Q: Can I reset my progress and start over?
**A:** Yes, but this action is permanent. Contact your instructor or support team to request a progress reset. Note that this will delete all your learning history and competency data.

#### Q: How do I set learning goals?
**A:** To set goals:
1. Go to your dashboard
2. Click "Set Learning Goals"
3. Choose goal type (competency, activity, time, or project)
4. Define specific, measurable objectives
5. Set realistic timelines
6. Track progress through your goal dashboard

## Learning and Progress Issues

### Activity and Assignment Problems

#### Q: My assignment won't submit
**Common causes and solutions:**

1. **Code errors**
   ```
   Check for:
   • Syntax errors in your code
   • Failed test cases
   • Missing required functions
   • Incorrect return types
   ```

2. **Technical issues**
   ```
   Try:
   • Refresh the page
   • Copy code to backup before refreshing
   • Check internet connection
   • Try submitting from different browser
   ```

3. **File size limits**
   ```
   Ensure:
   • Code files are under size limit
